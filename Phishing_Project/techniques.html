            <p>Credential harvesting is a cyberattack where attackers steal login credentials, such as usernames and passwords, often through phishing, as a first step to compromise accounts or systems.</p>            
        </div>
        
        <div class="container learning-container-2">
            <p>Smishing is phishing conducted through SMS or messaging apps. Attackers craft messages that seem urgent, enticing the victim to click a malicious link or reply with sensitive information. This method is increasingly popular as people rely heavily on mobile devices, making them more susceptible.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="container learning-container-3">
            <p>Email phishing is the most common form of phishing. Attackers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate organizations, such as banks, online retailers, or government agencies. These emails often create a sense of urgency to manipulate victims into clicking malicious links or downloading infected attachments. The ultimate goal is to steal sensitive information, such as passwords, credit card numbers, or personal data.</p>
        </div> 
        
        <div class="container learning-container-4">
            <p>Vishing uses phone calls instead of text to trick victims into providing sensitive information. Attackers often pose as trusted entities, like tech support, government officials, or customer service representatives, to manipulate the victim. They use social engineering tactics to create fear or urgency, prompting quick action.</p>
